# Finance-Data-Analysis

This Project will be built upon the analysis of the Finance Data Dataset found [here](https://www.kaggle.com/cnic92/200-financial-indicators-of-us-stocks-20142018) 

This Dataset Contains over 200 Financial indicators of US Stocks.
The main goal will be to try to predict a positive or a negative outlook for a single stock based on this data.
The last column of each dataset represent the class of each stock, where:

 - if the value of a stock increases at the end of the next year, then class=1;
 - if the value of a stock decreases at the end of the next year, then class=0.
